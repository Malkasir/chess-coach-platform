```

## Purpose

The analysis package serves multiple purposes:

1. **Feature Planning**: Comprehensive analysis before implementation
2. **Architecture Decisions**: Document technical choices and trade-offs
3. **Implementation Roadmap**: Break down features into manageable phases
4. **Cost/Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate development effort vs. user value
5. **Future Reference**: Historical record of design decisions

## How to Use

### For New Features
1. Copy `templates/feature-template.md` to `features/your-feature.md`
2. Fill out all sections thoroughly
3. Review with team before implementation
4. Update document as implementation progresses

### For Existing Features
- Reference existing analyses for context
- Update documents when requirements change
- Use as basis for refactoring decisions

## Analysis Standards

Each feature analysis should include:
- **Business justification** (why build this?)
- **Technical architecture** (how to build it?)
- **Implementation plan** (what steps to take?)
- **Risk assessment** (what could go wrong?)
- **Success metrics** (how to measure success?)

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough**: Better to over-analyze than under-analyze
- **Stay current**: Update documents when implementation diverges
- **Consider alternatives**: Document rejected approaches and why
- **Think long-term**: How will this feature evolve?
- **User-focused**: Always consider impact on user experience
