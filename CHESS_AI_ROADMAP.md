### **Data Flow**

1. **User selects personality** → PersonalityManager loads config
2. **Game starts** → AdaptiveDifficultyEngine sets initial parameters
3. **Player moves** → PerformanceAnalyzer tracks accuracy
4. **AI thinks** → StyleEngine applies personality to move selection
5. **Game continues** → AdaptiveDifficultyEngine adjusts based on performance
6. **Game ends** → Analysis stored for future adaptation
